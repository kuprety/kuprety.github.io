                As part of a research project exploring the use of AI and immersive technologies for creating inclusive classrooms, I developed wireframes in Figma to design the user interface for a centralized student hub. My role was to conceptualize and layout key pages like the home dashboard, course content area, discussion forums, and profile settings in order to create an accessible and engaging experience for all students. The goal of this project is to leverage innovative technologies to provide personalized and equitable learning opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds and learning needs.            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                This project is still a work in progress. The next steps are to use a Django framework to develop the Figma wireframes into an actual functioning platform. We are also working towards integrating chatbots, gamification, machine learning algorithms and other elements to bring the inclusive classroom vision to life.

            <strong>The Problem</strong>
        </span>

            <p>
                Traditional classrooms often struggle to provide an inclusive and personalized learning experience for all students. Factors like large class sizes, limited instructor availability, and lack of real-time feedback can negatively effect student engagement and performance. Additionally, there are disparities in educational outcomes between privileged and marginalized student groups. Students in marginalized positions may face barriers to learning like lack of access to technology, culturally-biased curriculums, and implicit biases that negatively affect their achievement and engagement.        
            </p>
            <p>
                Emerging learning technologies have the potential to address the lack of inclusion and meet the needs of underrepresented students. This formed part of the motivation behind our research - to explore how AI and immersive learning could transform standard classroom templates to be more engaging and equitable. Through our design, we aim to explore how emerging technologies could help close these persistent barriers and create more equitable learning opportunities for all students.
