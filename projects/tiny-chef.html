                <p id="space-on-top">
                    As a <strong>UX designer</strong>, I worked on ideating and designing Tiny Chef, an app that reimagines how
                    people connect through home cooking and recipe sharing. Working alongside a team, we
                    built an app that empowers users to make the most of their available ingredients while fostering a
                    community of home chefs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app originated from our team's shared passion for making home cooking more accessible and
                    sustainable. Through research and personal experiences, we identified a pressing issue—busy people
                    struggle to maintain healthy cooking habits while making the most of their available ingredients. As
                    a team exploring human-computer interaction, we wanted to transform this common challenge into an
                    opportunity for connection and creative cooking.

            <h3 id="problem-h3">The Problem</h3>
            <p id="the-problem">Research shows that preparing meals at home can improve not just physical health, but
                mental and emotional health as well. By preparing meals themselves, people can gain greater control over
                the ingredients they consume. Unfortunately, those who cook for themselves often encounter uncertainty
                when deciding what to prepare for their next meal. Furthermore, people may have ingredients available in
                their fridge but struggle to combine them into satisfying healthy dishes. This uncertainty can make it
                challenging to plan various fulfilling meals, leading to dissatisfaction and unused ingredients</p>

            <p id="the-problem">Couplet is an experience-curating app that reimagines how to cultivate a close community
                and foster meaningful connections among people through shared interests in local events and activities.
                Unlike traditional dating and social apps, Couplet focuses on a deeper, experience-based approach by
                connecting users who express similar interests in local gatherings, from arts and culture to non-profit
                events. By surfacing these unique experiences and making them more discoverable, Couplet helps create
                meaningful connections while supporting local organizations in reaching new audiences.</p>

                    intuitive. Our solution focused on making recipe discovery and saved collection simple to understand

                    To address feedback we received about it being confusing to know if an item is added to the cart, we displayed an "Added to Cart" message when an item is successfully added to their cart.                </p>

                    <p id="the-problem">  
                        The recipe discovery page serves as the homepage, where users can browse for recipes based on categories, search by ingredients, or look for a recipe using the search bar. Each recipe card has a picture, name, and time that represents how long it takes to cook it. When clicking on the recipe, it provides more details including a description, ingredients, and steps. Users can share the recipe or save it, which adds it to their collection.

                    <p id="the-problem"> 
                        The profile page serves as the user's personal representation on the platform. This is where the user can control their information, add any dietary restrictions, manage their account, and create posts by uploading recipes. We added a red plus button in the middle of the navigation bar, similar to many social media platforms to navigate users to the add post page. As users create a post, there is a progress bar at the top indicating the user's current status. Users also have the option to save their post as a draft if they want to finish adding details to their recipe later.

                    <p id="the-problem"> 
                        The market section of our app allows users to buy ingredients they may need for recipes in a simple way. Users can look for ingredients by selecting a category or using the search bar. There is an indicator at the bottom letting the user know how many items are in their cart. Each item available for sale has its own cateogory tag(s), the ability to select a quantity, desription, nutritional details, and the price. We added the category tags, so that if a user has a dietary restriction listed on their account, they won't be shown the products they cannot consume.                    </p>

                    <h3 id="problem-h3">Final Thoughts</h3>

                    <p id="the-problem">
                        Through this project, I had the opportunity to practice rigorous user testing, such as paper prototyping and heuristic evaluation. Those experiences taught me the importance of making iterations when creating an app, since it led to significant design improvements, from the addition of a search bar for dietary restrictions to adding the add post feature to the navigation bar. We also learned the importance of clear navigation, error prevention, and the importance of accessible design.
