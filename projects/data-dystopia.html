                    Data Dystopia is an interactive how-to website that educates users about online privacy and data
                    surveillance. It uses engaging storytelling elements and simulated real-world scenarios to
                    demonstrate the invisible data collection and tracking that happens on most websites. The website
                    guides users through experiences that empower them to think critically about their digital privacy.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Main features I created include a misleading endless loading bar, glitch effects over privacy
                    policies to
                    represent the lack of transparency in data practices, interactive elements that react to user clicks
                    to simulate data tracking, and scenarios that let users see different outcomes based on the privacy
                    decisions they make while online shopping. The website aims to make the complex concepts around data
                    privacy more understandable and relatable. Its playful yet unsettling interactions push people to
                    question norms of data collection and take control of their digital presence.

                    <p>
                        While many internet users are concerned about online privacy and data collection, the actual
                        scope and invisibility of surveillance practices on common digital platforms is not fully
                        understood by the average user. Websites and services often gather incredible amounts of
                        personal data and activity logs - tracking movements, interests, purchases, and more - typically
                        without consent. However, these data practices are so technically complicated and intentionally
                        hidden that most users feel confused, overwhelmed, and powerless in terms of protecting their
                        own privacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was inspired by the clickclickclick.click website, which aims to educate internet users about
                        online tracking in an interactive, eye-opening way. I wanted to incorporate this style of
                        tangible, interactive elements that react to users and reveal invisible concepts. Showing data
                        surveillance practices in a visible, experiential way can educate users more effectively
                        compared to just textual explanations. This guided my design thinking.- leading me to include
                        interactive elements like an endless loading bar and clicks that immediately show where or how
                        many times the user has clicked.
