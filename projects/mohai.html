                    This project explores the design process of developing an app platform for the Museum of History &
                    Industry's Native Ground exhibit. It outlines the design and layout considerations we made when
                    designing the app. </p>
                <p>
                    We were asked to update the current Native Ground exhibit in MOHAI to be more interactive and
                    accessible. We needed to create an app platform that effectively displayed information about various
                    artifacts, honored Indigenous communities' stories and traditions in the Pacific Northwest, and
                    provided an immersive, educational experience for museum visitors of the Native Ground exhibition.
                    We were challenged with presenting a large amount of information about various Indigenous artifacts
                    and jewelry in a way that was interactive, user-friendly, visually appealing, and did not overwhelm
                    users with an excessive amount of text. </p>

                        The design problem we addressed through this project was ideating how to create an app platform

                        correspond with each Native Ground exhibit to enhance the learning experience.

            <p class="left">
                We started by creating a template for a semi-structured interview to address the main concerns of going
                to the MOHAI museum, museums in general, and the technology used to determine what problem our product
                should target. </p>

                    <p>
                        We chose this type of interview because they include the questions we prepared, but they also
                        allocate space to ask spontaneous follow-up questions so we can ensure that we leave the
                        interview with no lingering questions or doubts.

                    <p>
                        Our interview data overall showed us that people think that museums tend to be boring when
                        exhibits are non-interactive or if museums are popular, they are crowded, and information is
                        hard to read from far away.
