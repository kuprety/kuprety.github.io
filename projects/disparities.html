            <p>The effects of climate change are not equal. It carries ethical dimensions that leave countries in the Global South most vulnerable. Even within the Global South, there are more extents of power that amplify existing inequalities. This is seen from the lived experiences of women within these countries. Structural inequalities established in the distribution of rights, assets, resources, and power leave women behind in the changing climate.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I created this project because of my lived experiences as a Nepalese woman. My mother grew up in Jhapa, Nepal, and did not have any similar opportunities as her male family members due to the rigid patriarchy. I wanted to research what women are going through right now in Nepal due to the global injustice of climate change.</p>
