                    As a <strong id="description">UX designer at Generate</strong>, I helped design and launch
                    <strong>Couplet</strong>, an app that reimagines how people discover and engage with local events.
                    Working alongside our team of designers and developers, we built an app that is powered by
                    <strong>connecting users based on their interests</strong>, with an emphasis on surfacing unique,
                    <strong>community-driven experiences</strong> that often fly under the radar of mainstream
                    platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app originated from Victoria and Jan, two Boston-based founders passionate about making arts and
                    culture more accessible. Victoria's background in nonprofit research and consulting identified a
                    pressing issueâ€”<strong>cultural organizations were struggling to connect with younger
                        audiences</strong>. Partnering with Jan, a software engineer and Northeastern alum, they reached
                    out to Generate to transform their idea into a reality.

            <h3 id="problem-h3">The Problem</h3>
            <p id="the-problem">In this digital era, we're getting more disconnected from authentic, in-person
                experiences despite being
                more "connected' than ever. Traditional social and dating apps often create shallow, superficial
                connections based on appearances and quick judgments, leaving many young people dissatisfied and craving
                more meaningful ways to connect with others. Local events held by organizations and nonprofits
                provide experiences that could bring people together. Yet these events often struggle to reach younger
                audiences, who are often unaware that these experiences exist or find them difficult to discover
                through mainstream platforms. This leads to a missed opportunity: young people wanting to form real
                connections
                and organizations eager to bring people together but lacking an effective way to bridge this gap.</p>

            <p id="the-problem">Couplet is an experience-curating app that reimagines how to cultivate a close community
                and foster meaningful connections among people through shared interests in local events and activities.
                Unlike traditional dating and social apps, Couplet focuses on a deeper, experience-based approach by
                connecting users who express similar interests in local gatherings, from arts and culture to non-profit
                events. By surfacing these unique experiences and making them more discoverable, Couplet helps create
                meaningful connections while supporting local organizations in reaching new audiences.</p>

                <h3 id="problem-h3">Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <p id="the-problem">By looking into what's already out there and learning what features our
                    competitors' apps provide, we were able to better understand what certain platforms already offer.
                    We learned that most existing platforms mostly focus on the event listings but lack meaningful
                    social connection features. While many platforms are catered at either social connection or event
                    discovery, none effectively combined both to create meaningful, interest-based connections through
                    shared experiences. This helped shape Couplet's unique approach of bringing people together.</p>

                <h3 id="problem-h3">User Personas</h3>
                <p id="the-problem">We came up with 4 users of our app and ideated background information for each of
                    them. Creating these personas helped us think deeply about our audience and their needs. Each
                    persona varied in age, occupation, and goals. This helped us understand the various groups who would
                    use our platform.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 id="problem-h3">Existing Alternatives</h3>
                <p id="the-problem">We examined several traditional dating apps and local event platforms including
                    Hinge, Joyraft, S'more, Duo, and the Bosotn Calendar. We noticed that these platforms often
                    struggled to include both - social connection and event discovery. This is what sets Couplet apart
                    from our competitors. While our competitors' platforms offer different approaches to event discovery
                    and social interaction, each has distinct limitations. For instance, many of the event apps shares
                    our vision of connection through experiences, but Couplet distinguishes itself by facilitating both
                    dating and friendship connections among strangers who share cultural interests. Traditional event
                    calendars such as the Boston Calendar serve primarily as directories, missing the needed social
                    connection element that makes Couplet's engaging approach stand out.</p>

                    Creating a moodboard was a crucial early step in our design process, helping us establish the right
                    visual tone for our app. We curated images, typography, and color schemes that we felt evoked
                    feelings of <strong>creativity</strong>, <strong>community</strong>, and <strong>discovery</strong>.
                    This led us to a palette with bright colors, bold typography, and fluid shapes as we wanted our app
                    to be inviting for users and to stand out against competitors.

                    After exploring various font options, we selected our final one during our all hands meeting by

                    the fonts in nuse across three different lofi wireframe screens. Then, we each gave our input and
                    showed our options to potential users to hear their input before making our final decision. </p>

                <p id="the-problem">
                    I designed many different logos and came up with various color schemes. We tested the variations by
                    asking people in our target demographic which one they resonated with the best given our app's
                    focus. I noticed that most people were drawn to the tickets forming a heart, as it accurately
                    illustrates both the events and matchmaking aspect of the app. For colors, people preferred the
                    softer palette, but advised us to avoid green as it reminded them of a finance app, and to avoid
                    yellow as it's similar to Hinge's branding.

                    Creating a welcoming and effective profile setup experience was important for our app. Our research

                    focused on making this process both engaging and and smooth. After analyzing the onboarding design
                    of our competitor apps, we came up with the following key design decisions:

                <h3 id="problem-h3">Matchmaking Flow</h3>

                <p id="the-problem">
                    An important aspect of Couplet is meeting new people that share similar interests, so the
                    matchmaking flow was an essential part of our app. We needed our matchmaking system to faciliate
                    meaningful connections, but had to be creative with how the matching process would work since
                    Couplet doesn't allow matches to message each other due to engineering limitations. Therefore, our
                    temporary workaround is to exchange users' social media handles such as Instagram or Whatsapp when a
                    pair is matched. It would also show any events that they have in common with a potential match, so
                    they would be able to plan a date much smoother.
                </p>

                            Created a <strong>streamlined connection process </strong>that allows users to share social
