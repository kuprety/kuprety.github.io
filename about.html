        <p>Hi, I'm Kritika (she/her), a third-year Computer Science and Design (BS) student at Northeastern. 
            I'm a first generation Nepalese-American immigrant with a passion for learning how technology can be a tool for social good.
       <br>
       <br>
       I’ve been involved in various personal and collaborative projects within the fields of computer science and design that have allowed me to strengthen my skills in programming languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as design platforms such as Figma, Illustrator, Axure, and InDesign. 
       <br>
       <br>
       I aspire to work in the field of human-computer interaction, an interdisciplinary field that revolves around human-centered design and computing. I believe in the power of using human-centered design to create more inclusive design that centers people in marginalized positions.       I love gaining new experiences that allow me to explore my passion for computer science and design through multifaceted lenses.
